A Simple Countdown App For the Mac

<img align="center" src="https://github.com/egosapien/T-Minus/blob/master/T-Minus/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/t-%20copy-1.png">

Includes today widget, and allows for tracking up to 10 deadlines. Very simple app, mainly created it because I didn't find any simillar apps that I liked.

Core logic is written in C, used this app as an opportunity to work a bit with it. Long-term, I want to make the same app for Windows/Android/iOS/Mac all using the same logic.
